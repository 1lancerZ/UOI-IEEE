                University of Leicester IEEE IAS/PELS Joint Student Branch Chapter Shines at Manchester Transport Electrification Workshop
                Recently, a team of MSc and PhD students from the University of Leicester IEEE Industrial Applications Society (IAS) and Power Electronics Society (PELS) Joint Student Branch Chapter, supervised by Dr. Bing Ji, participated in a two-day workshop on Transport Electrification at the National Graphene Institute, University of Manchester. The team showcased cutting-edge research and shared the chapter’s innovative activities, highlighting its unique influence as an international academic community.
              </p>
              <p>
                As the first student chapter jointly supported by the University of Leicester (UK) and Dalian Leicester Institute (China), the organization has rapidly become a model for interdisciplinary collaboration since its founding in January 2025. With 24 active members including undergraduate and PhD students from diverse backgrounds such as electrical engineering and materials science, it is dedicated to building a "student-led, cross-border" technical exchange platform. Within weeks of its establishment, the chapter successfully launched the academic seminar "Lightning-Fast Protection: Unlocking the Secrets of SiC MOSFET Safety for Transport Applications", engaging students from both campuses and bridging the gap between advanced research and engineering practice.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the field of practical innovation, the chapter’s co-hosted LEICESTER CIRCUIT DESIGN CONTEST has become a highlight. The contest requires teams to include members from both UK and China campuses, encouraging innovation in analog, digital, and embedded systems. Each team can receive up to 200 in hardware development subsidies, with a total prize pool of 3,900 sponsored by IEEE societies, universities, and industries. The event not only promotes cross-campus collaboration but also advocates for diversity and inclusion through awards like the "Woman-in-Electronics (WiE) Award".
              </p>
              <p>
                The chapter’s participation in the Manchester workshop further demonstrates its global vision. The research shared by the team focused on power electronics for electric vehicles, aligning with the chapter’s mission to "link academic frontiers with industry needs". A chapter representative stated that future plans include deepening academic collaboration between UK and China campuses through joint webinars, technical competitions, and mentor exchanges, while welcoming more scholars and students to join this cross-border technical community.
